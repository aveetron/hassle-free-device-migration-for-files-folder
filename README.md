# hassle-free-device-migration-for-files-folders

When we change our local machine, we need to move manually our local informations/files/folders. And after installing new os/ device we need to restore those informations/files/folders. It's a problem for me to copy/download those informations/files/folders.

So, this program will automatically store local informations/files/folders into cloud and after installing new os/ changing new device , the program will automatically restore those files and as per folders.

If anyone wants to make a pull/start with this idea, feel free.

Thank you.
